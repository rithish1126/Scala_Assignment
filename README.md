Q1)The class that contains all the required functions regarding finding the bucket in which a number belongs to.
'''

Buckets :
0.000 -0.049

0.050-0.099

0.100-0.149

0.150-0.199

0.200-0.249

0.250-0.299

0.300-0.349

0.350-0.399

100.000-100.049
'''

//We notice that all the bucket bounds have a difference of 0.049 so we just take the input of the number and take the last two digits
//to see if it falls in the bucket xx.00 - xx.x49 or xx.x50 - xx.x99
